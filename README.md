A pure java MIP Solver perfect for hard NP Problems. 

State-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi, CPLEX and XPress are fast, robust, but expensive. The idea behind this project is to develop a complete set of optimization libraries in Java for making embeded Decision Support Systems (DSS) for commercial and academic use. <br>

The idea is to develop the following capabilities in the project:<br>

Exact Algorithms<br>
1) A fast LP Solver with the Simplex Algorithm implemented in standard and tableau format. <br>
2) A pool of polynomial time interior point methods for LP. <br>
3) A MIP Solver that implements Branch and Bounding, Branch and Cut, and Branch and Price. <br>
4) Column Generation<br>
5) Dantzig-Wolf Decomposition<br>
6) Benders Decomposition<br>
7) Network efficient algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra)<br>

Metaheuristics<br>
1) A pool of metaheuristics, and mateheuristics for combinatorial problems. <br>


Specific frameworks<br>
1) A Object-Oriented framework for solving VRPTW, CVRP, and other variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem.<br>
2) Supply Chain problems<br>

Current Work:

The following modules are close to be done:

1) Simplex <br>
2) Branch & Bound <br>
