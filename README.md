A pure java MIP Solver perfect for hard NP Problems. 

State-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi, CPLEX and XPress are fast, robust, but expensive. The idea behind this project is to develop a complete set of optimization libraries in Java for making embeded Decision Support Systems (DSS) for commercial and academic use. 

The idea is to develop the following capabilities in the project:

Exact Algorithms
1) An fast LP Solver with the Simplex Algorithm implemented in standard and tableau format. 
2) A pool of polynomial time interior point methods for LP. 
3) A MIP Solver that implements Branch and Bounding, Branch and Cut, and Branch and Price. 
4) Column Generation
5) Dantzig-Wolf Decomposition
6) Benders Decomposition
7) Network efficient algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra)

Metaheuristics
1) A pool of metaheuristics, and mateheuristics for combinatorial problems. 


Specific frameworks
1) A Object-Oriented framework for solving VRPTW, CVRP, and other variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem.
2) Supply Chain problems
